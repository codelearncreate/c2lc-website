# Release 1.8 of Weavly

While working with the [Beverley School](https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/beverleyschool/),
the Weavly team learned how important music is to the students.

This is why Weavly has musical sounds that accompany the movement of a character.
You'll find an activity that helps learners
[explore sounds in Weavly](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/exploring-weavly-sounds/)
in the Educator's Toolkit.

Now we also have a new Music Band Stage background in the Weavly coding environment.
Check out the latest release of
[Weavly](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.10&t=default&w=MusicBand)
to try it out.
