On June 8th and 9th, [the Beverley School](https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/beverleyschool) and the Coding to Learn and Create team held a joint exhibition that showcased the many unique expressions to be found at the intersection of creativity, ability, and diversity.

Through large scale, mixed media artworks, Collocation weaves together the many unique expressions of Beverley's students in a dynamic rhythm of colour, gesture, and texture.
