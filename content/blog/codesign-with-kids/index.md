# Co-Designing With Children with Disabilities Resource

{{< youtube HuYv7T2hb8s >}}

The many people who have collaborated on the creation of the
[Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org/)
and the associated
[Weavly Educator's Toolkit](https://weavly.org/),
have combined their collective learnings and experience into a new resource about
[co-designing with children with disabilities](https://co-design.weavly.org/).

The resource offers a set of recommendations to enable designers, children, teachers,
and caregivers to work in a collaborative process, in areas such as design research,
creative expression, learning objectives, and more.

Check out the video above for more information on co-designing with children with disabilities.
