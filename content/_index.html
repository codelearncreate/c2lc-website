            <p>We’re designing <strong>educational coding tools</strong> for kids who have been left out of learning—especially those with complex needs.</p>
            <p>We’re also sharing <strong>free creative activities, lessons, and projects</strong> that help kids learn, develop social and communication skills, and express themselves with code.</p>

            <h2>More Than Just Learning to Code</h2>
            <p>Students with disabilities often depend on digital technology and adapted instruction to participate in class, communicate with family, and share with their friends. Our goal is to <strong>empower all learners to be creators</strong> of their digital worlds, to <strong>express themselves using code and art</strong>, and to apply these skills to other areas of <strong>learning and daily life</strong>. Not just learning to code, but coding to learn and create.</p>
