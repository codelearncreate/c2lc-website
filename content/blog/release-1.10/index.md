# Custom Backgrounds in Weavly

Over the past few years, the Weavly team has consistently heard from learners and
educators that they want the ability to build their own backgrounds in the
[Weavly coding environment](https://create.weavly.org).
In the summer of 2023, we created a prototype and worked with kids to
[co-design the custom background feature](https://www.codelearncreate.org/blog/custom-backgrounds-codesign/).

You can now modify an existing background or create a new background using many
different coloured tiles along with gems, gold and treats.
There is also a special wall tile that will stop the character from moving.

Watch the video below to find out how to use this feature and check out the recent
[1.10 release of Weavly](https://create.weavly.org) to try it out yourself.
